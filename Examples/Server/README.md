# Server Example

A small application which starts up a DNS server and redirects the provided domains to localhost.

	ServerExample.exe foo.com google.com

Runing the above and configuring the machine to use locahost for DNS resolution, will redirect you to localhost when visiting `foo.com` in a browser.
